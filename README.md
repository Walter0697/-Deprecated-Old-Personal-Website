### Personal Website
##### Reworking personal website

## Technology:
- react-native
- react-spring animation library

## Still working on:
- Resume webpage
- Others

## So far what I have:
- Main page with react-spring (ParallaxLayer)
- Project page with react-bootstrap
- Mobile Project page with animejs
- Status page with react-sortable-hoc (not a library)

## What I discovered (hey this is mainly written for my future self):
- react-spring has ParallaxLayer for 7.2.8, not the latest version
- ubuntu server needs to handle the temporary memory to do npm install
- instead of using gif, using multiple png will make things less laggy
- mobile site, figuring the layout, could be better
- instead of disabling the scrolling, make an illusion of that might be better
- svg is good, but not all icons are good with svg
- using SSL to secure now
- you can actually hide your source code in react

## Reminder for myself:
- using multiple animation libraries for different pages seem like a fun idea
- Mobile Project page can't show info right now, might implement later
- what exactly can i do for resume webpage, let's think
- what's next?
